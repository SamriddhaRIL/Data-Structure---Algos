######## Lists ############ 

## Arrays as Dynamic List Approch --> 

1. Empty List has size 0.

2. We should be able to perform functions like : 
- insert
- remove 
- count
- read/modify element at a position
- specify data-type

3. When Arrey is full create a new arry of double size. 
Copy elements from previous arry in new once. And delete the 
old arrey. 

4. Time Coplexity of a simple list :
    A . Access - Read / write element at an index -> O(1) / Constant time
    B . Insert ->  O(n) | proportional to size of the array.
    C . Remove ->  O(n) | proportional to size of the array.
    D . Add ->     O(n) | Worst time complexity will be O(n) if the cureent array
    is full and we are creating a new array coping all the elements to the new array.
