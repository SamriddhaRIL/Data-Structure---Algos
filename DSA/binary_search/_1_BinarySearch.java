 * Video Explanation :
 *
 * 704. Binary Search
 * Solved
 * Easy
 *
 * Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order,
 * and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums.
 * If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.
 *
 * You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2
 * Output: -1
 * Explanation: 2 does not exist in nums so return -1
 *
 * Constraints:
 *     1 <= nums.length <= 104
 *     -104 < nums[i], target < 104
 *     All the integers in nums are unique.
 *     nums is sorted in ascending order.
