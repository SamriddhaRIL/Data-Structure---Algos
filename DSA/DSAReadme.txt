Complete DSA Learning Sequence (Steps 1-18) :
[ We will cover all the topics first by following the below steps. Will not spend too much time on a single topic
  first goal is to touch all the topic. We will come back cover lot more problems once all the major
  topics/basics are covered.
]

Step 1: Learn Important Sorting Techniques
Step 2: Solve Problems on Arrays [Easy → Medium → Hard] - Done (Comeback and Practice)
Step 3: Learn LinkedList [Single LL, Double LL, Medium, Hard Problems] - Done (Comeback and Practice)
Step 4: Stack and Queues [Learning, Pre-In-Post-fix, Monotonic Stack, Implementation]
Step 5: Strings [Basic and Medium]
Step 6: Recursion [PatternWise] - Done (Comeback and Practice)
Step 7: Binary Search [1D, 2D Arrays, Search Space]
Step 8: Sliding Window & Two Pointer Combined Problems
Step 9: Bit Manipulation [Concepts & Problems]
Step 10: Heaps [Learning, Medium, Hard Problems]
Step 11: Greedy Algorithms [Easy, Medium/Hard]
Step 12: Binary Trees [Traversals, Medium and Hard Problems]
Step 13: Binary Search Trees [Concept and Problems]
Step 14: Graphs [Concepts & Problems]
Step 15: Dynamic Programming [Patterns and Problems]
Step 16: Tries
Step 17: Strings [Advanced topics]
