Complete DSA Learning Sequence (Steps 1-18) :
[ We will cover all the topics first by following the below steps. Will not spend too much time on a single topic
  first goal is to touch all the topic. We will come back cover lot more problems once all the major
  topics/basics are covered.
]

Step 1: Learn Important Sorting Techniques

Step 2: Solve Problems on Arrays [Easy → Medium → Hard] - Revision 1
- Comeback for Hard/Practice.

Step 3: Learn LinkedList [Single LL, Double LL, Medium, Hard Problems] - Revision 2
- Basic And Medium Problems Done. Comeback for Hard/Practice.

Step 4: Stack and Queues [Learning, Pre-In-Post-fix, Monotonic Stack, Implementation]
- Skipped : Pre-In-Post-fix conversions (Will comeback when have time)
- Basic, Medium, Hard Problems Done. Few hard are skipped for now. Comeback for Hard/Practice.

Step 5: Strings [Basic and Medium]
No of problems : 14 problem. 4 days max as these are easy/medium problems.
- Basic And Medium Problems Done. Comeback for Hard/Practice.

Step 6: Recursion & Backtracking [PatternWise]
- Basic, Medium, Hard Problems Done. Few hard are skipped for now. Comeback for Hard/Practice.

Step 7: Binary Search [1D, 2D Arrays, Search Space]
No of problems : 8 + 8 + 3 = 19 problems. 2-3 problems/day so total 6-8 days,
- Basic, Medium, Hard Problems Done. Comeback for Practice.

Step 8: Sliding Window & Two Pointer Combined Problems

Step 9: Bit Manipulation [Concepts & Problems]
- Skipped : Will comeback when have time

Step 10: Binary Trees [Traversals, Medium and Hard Problems]

Step 11: Binary Search Trees [Concept and Problems]

Step 12: Heaps [Learning, Medium, Hard Problems]

Step 13: Greedy Algorithms [Easy, Medium/Hard]
- Basic And Few Medium Problems Done. Comeback for more problems/Practice.

Step 14: Graphs [Concepts & Problems]

Step 15: Dynamic Programming [Patterns and Problems]

Step 16: Tries

Step 17: Strings [Advanced topics]
